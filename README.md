# 🌞 Solar Filament Detection and Classification

## Overview

This repository contains a complete pipeline for the **detection**, **segmentation**, and **classification** of solar filaments from H-α images. We combine traditional morphological techniques with modern deep learning models such as **U-Net** and **YOLO**. A key novelty of this work is the **automatic classification of filament chirality** (left, right-bearing, or unidentifiable) based on barb orientation using deep learning.
